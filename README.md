# PyBer_Analysis
### Analysis Overview
  The purpose of this analysis was to assist V.Isualize and Omar with their company at PyBer using Pandas and Matplotlib to aquire ride-sharing data. In the intial analysis 2 CSV file were merged and manipulated to gather data on various aspects of ride-sharing service across different types of cities. Using Matplotlib I was able to effieciently gather and visualize data to further present to V.Isualize and to PyBer. However for further analysis I was tasked with making a multiple-line graph based on weekly fares for each data type.
